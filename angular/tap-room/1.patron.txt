1.(DONE)As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store). 
2.As a patron and/or employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. (Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints)
3.(DONE)As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. Perhaps based on their price (greater or less than $5 per pint, perhaps) or the particular style of beer or kombucha.
4.As a patron, I want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers.
