1.As an employee, I want to fill out a form(name,brand,price,alcohol content,pints) when I tap a new keg to add it to the list. (Don't worry about authenticating employee user accounts yet.)
2.As an employee, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
3.(DONE)As a patron and/or employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. (Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints). 
4.As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1.
5.(DONE)As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them.
